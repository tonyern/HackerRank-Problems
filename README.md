# Technologies
I am using Java to solve HackerRank's coding challenges. I am using IntelliJ as my IDE.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to store all my solutions to problems where I can look back on if I encounter it again or a problem similar to it. It also may help others in seeing an efficient or not so efficient way of solving things.
